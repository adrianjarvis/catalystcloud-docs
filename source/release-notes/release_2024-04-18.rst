==================================
Catalyst Cloud Kubernetes Service
==================================

We have released Cluster Templates for Kubernetes 1.28. From this version
onwards, our service is powered by Cluster API which greatly improves how we
support, manage and upgrade your clusters.

We have also updated the Kubernetes documentation section with examples and
up to date information.

The :ref:`supported-kubernetes-versions` section may be of special note to
users who want to know dates to expect for version release and deprecation.

To get started using our CNCF Certified Kubernetes service, follow the
:ref:`Kubernetes Quick-Start Guide<k8s-quickstart>`.

===================
Deprecation Notices
===================

------------------------
Magnum Cluster Templates
------------------------

With the release of 1.28 for Catalyst Cloud Kubernetes Service, clusters
built on 1.25 now transition to unsupported and 1.25 Cluster Templates
are now hidden from the API.

See :ref:`supported-kubernetes-versions` for more information.
